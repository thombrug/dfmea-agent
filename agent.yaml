description: >
  Executes a Design Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (DFMEA) for engineering
  systems. Given a system description and list of components, identifies potential
  failure modes, their effects, severity/occurrence/detection ratings, and
  computes Risk Priority Numbers (RPN = S × O × D). Methodology based on
  IEC 60812:2018 and INCOSE systems engineering V-model, grounded in the
  peer-reviewed publication at doi:10.3390/su12010077.

      Executes a full Design Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (DFMEA) on the
      provided engineering system. Analyzes each component for potential failure
      modes, rates them on Severity, Occurrence, and Detection scales (1-10),
      computes Risk Priority Numbers (RPN), classifies risk levels, and generates
      an HTML matrix report. Based on IEC 60812:2018 methodology.
